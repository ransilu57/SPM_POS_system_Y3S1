## ✨ New Features Added

### 1. **API Utility Module** (`src/utils/api.js`)
Created centralized API utility for all backend calls:
- **Auth API**: login, register, logout
- **Products API**: getAll, getById, create, update, delete
- **Cashiers API**: getAll, getById, update, delete
- **Dashboard API**: getStats
- **Benefits**:
  - Consistent error handling
  - Centralized token management
  - Cleaner component code
  - Easy to maintain and update

### 2. **ProtectedRoute Component** (`src/components/ProtectedRoute.jsx`)
Added route protection with role-based access:
- **Features**:
  - Checks authentication token
  - Validates user role (admin/cashier)
  - Auto-redirects unauthorized users
  - Prevents direct URL access to restricted pages

### 3. **Updated App.jsx**
Enhanced routing with protection:
- All admin routes require admin role
- Cashier route requires cashier role
- Automatic redirection for unauthorized access
- Cleaner route structure

## 🔄 Data Structure Alignment

### Product Object
**Backend Response:**
```javascript
{
  _id: "507f1f77bcf86cd799439011",
  name: "Product Name",
  description: "Product Description",
  unitPrice: 99.99,
  quantity: 50,
  image: "data:image/jpeg;base64,..."
}
```

**Frontend Usage:**
- ✅ Uses `_id` for identification
- ✅ Uses `unitPrice` for pricing
- ✅ Displays base64 image directly

### User/Cashier Object
**Backend Requirements:**
```javascript
{
  username: "required",
  email: "required",
  password: "required (min 8 chars, uppercase, lowercase, number)",
  role: "admin" or "cashier"
}
```

**Frontend Implementation:**
- ✅ All fields included in forms
- ✅ Validation matches backend requirements
- ✅ Password strength hints displayed
